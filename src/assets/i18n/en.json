This concept, which earned us the title of laureate at the Howest Social Creativity Cup 2020, revolves around sustainability and connection. We came up with a biomeiler, which would generate heat from the composting process of wood chips and thus supply a workshop space and greenhouse with energy. For the electricity needs of the garden, we proposed the use of solar panels on the Roeselare Expohallen, so that the entire project runs on renewable energy. In addition, we wanted to involve local residents from the start by inviting them as volunteers to build the biomeiler together. Although the project was not carried out, the aim was to design a social and sustainable initiative that is both environmentally friendly and community-strengthening."
